Contributers: Anastasios Pagiatakis (Github: tp218), Chase Behrens, Robert Giering

A robot that will patrol around and search for motion. When it detects motion, it will move toward it.

Robot has the capability to move forward, backward, left, and right.

Currently Working on: Giving the robot paths and seeing how well it can take them. Working through what kinds of angles it takes. Also working with taking data from a camera and processing it to detect movement.
